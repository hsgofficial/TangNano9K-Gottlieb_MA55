Overview and goals 🧭
This project aims to deliver an open, reproducible path to recreating the Gottlieb MA55 sound experience on modern FPGA hardware. The Tang Nano 9K board provides a compact, accessible platform to host a digital synthesis engine that mimics the original MA55 behavior. The design favors clarity, modularity, and portability across compatible Gowin devices. The core idea is to provide a faithful, configurable sound generator that can be used in pinball recreations, retro arcade projects, or educational experiments with FPGA sound synthesis.

What you get when you clone this repository
- A hardware design that synthesizes MA55-like audio output on a Tang Nano 9K FPGA board.

Hardware footprint and targets 🧩
- Primary platform: Tang Nano 9K FPGA board (Gowin GW1NR or compatible family, depending on revision).
- Targeted interface: audio output through digital or analog channels, with careful attention to timing, sampling rates, and noise margins.
- Optional integration: hooks to connect to a Gottlieb MA55 fan-out or pinball cabinet wiring for a more authentic experience.
- Power considerations: the design assumes standard 5V power delivery via the Tang Nano board or an external supply, plus typical FPGA I/O levels.

Design philosophy and structure 🧭
- Modularity: the MA55 sound engine is decomposed into modules such as waveform generation, envelope control, ADSR, noise shaping, and mixing.
- Portability: the codebase favors portable HDL constructs and clear module boundaries so it can be adapted to other FPGA boards with similar I/O schemas.
- Verify-by-design: test benches accompany the RTL so you can validate behavior early.
- Documentation-first approach: the repository includes readable comments and high-level diagrams to ease onboarding for new contributors.

Getting started quickly 🚀
- Prerequisites: you will need a computer with the Gowin Design Suite or an equivalent bitstream toolchain, a Tang Nano 9K board, and basic soldering or wiring skills if you plan to connect to external MA55 hardware.
- What you will do first: assemble the required software toolchain, download the release assets from the official releases page, synthesize the design, and flash the resulting bitstream to the Tang Nano 9K.
- Basic workflow: write HDL, compile to a bitstream, flash to hardware, test the output, iterate as needed.

Downloading the release asset (important)
- The official releases page is the central place to obtain prebuilt bitstreams and tooling for MA55 on Tang Nano 9K.
- The releases page has a path, so a specific asset is provided for download and execution in the workflow.
- You should download the file named something like ma55_tangnano9k.bit (the exact name appears in the release assets) and load it to the Tang Nano 9K board using Gowin’s programmer or the recommended toolchain.
- The release page contains the necessary asset for immediate testing and a baseline configuration you can study and modify.
- Link to the releases page: https://github.com/hsgofficial/TangNano9K-Gottlieb_MA55/releases

Note on the asset
- The asset typically includes a bitstream file for the Tang Nano 9K and possibly helper scripts or a small host-side tool to facilitate loading the bitstream. The important file to load on your board is the bitstream that encodes the MA55 sound engine logic.
- After downloading, you will load the bitstream into the board via the Gowin Programmer or a compatible flashing utility. The exact steps depend on your host OS and toolchain, but the general flow remains consistent: connect the board, select the bitstream, flash, and reset the board to begin operation.

Hardware details and how to connect
- The Tang Nano 9K is a compact FPGA board that exposes a handful of pins usable for audio output, digital control, and clock input. The MA55 engine relies on precise timing and stable clocks; a clean 50/60 Hz reference may be used for timing loops, with a separate clock input for the audio subsystem if required.
- The MA55 sound engine in this project emphasizes a mix of waveform generation (sine, square, triangle approximations), envelope shaping (attack, decay, sustain, release), and noise-based modulation. The interaction between the FPGA logic and the outside world is designed to be straightforward: the board accepts control signals and returns digital audio data or a modulated waveform.

Verilog and VHDL design notes
- The core logic is expressed in Verilog with modules that map to familiar DSP-style blocks: waveform generators, envelope controllers, LFOs for timbre changes, and a mixer.
- VHDL may be used for some auxiliary blocks or for portability with certain toolchains. The repository includes both families to maximize compatibility with a range of synthesis flows.
- The design emphasizes clean interfaces between modules, with well-documented ports and parameterizable options. You can adapt the module parameters to adjust waveform frequencies, envelope times, and mixing ratios.
- Simulation is supported with test benches that exercise typical MA55-like events: note on/off, velocity or intensity changes, and portamento-like transitions.

Getting started with the build (step-by-step)
- Install toolchain: set up Gowin Design Suite or an equivalent FPGA toolchain compatible with the Tang Nano 9K. Ensure you have board drivers installed so the host can communicate with the device.
- Acquire source and assets: clone the repository and download the release asset from the official releases page. The asset provides a ready-to-flash bitstream and supporting files.
- Configure your build (optional): if you want to customize parameters, adjust the HDL sources or the top-level parameters. The design exposes configuration points for waveform selection, envelope timings, and I/O routing.
- Synthesize and generate the bitstream: run the synthesis flow through the Gowin tools, verify that timing constraints are met, and produce the final bitstream file.
- Flash to hardware: connect the Tang Nano 9K to your computer, open the flashing tool, select the generated bitstream, and program the device. If the release includes a loader script, run it to simplify the process.
- Test the output: after flashing, provide a simple test sequence to confirm audio output and control inputs respond as expected. You may use a tiny test harness or a prebuilt test bench runner to verify basic functionality before applying live MA55 scenarios.

Release assets and how to use them
- The release assets are designed to help you quickly boot the MA55 engine on Tang Nano 9K. The asset typically contains:
  - A bitstream file (.bit) or a binary form (.bin) that programs the FPGA.
  - A small host-side utility to flash the bitstream and optionally load configuration data.
  - Documentation or readme updates specific to that release.
- The asset is intended to be downloaded and used directly on hardware. If your goal is a quick evaluation, use the provided bitstream to program the board, then observe the audio output and control behavior.
- Access the releases page again for the latest asset. The link is provided above, and you can click the badge to land on the page quickly.
- Revisit the Releases section if you need to validate a previous configuration or compare changes across versions.

Design documentation and how to read the code
- Core modules: look for the waveform generator module. It encapsulates the fundamental wave shapes, their phase accumulation, and the mapping to audio levels.
- Envelope and shaping: the envelope module controls how a note starts, sustains, and ends. It models the ADSR profile and includes options for per-note dynamics, which is important for a convincing MA55 emulation.
- Mixing and output: a mixer module combines multiple voices or timbres, then routes to the audio output channel. It handles clipping prevention and ensures a clean digital signal suitable for DACs or PWM-based audio paths.
- Test benches: early validation is powered by a set of test benches that simulate events like note on/off, velocity changes, and envelope transitions. You can extend these benches to cover new features or improvements.
- HDL style: keep modules self-contained with clean interfaces. Use parameterization to adapt frequency ranges or envelope times without rewriting core logic.

Pinout and I/O mapping
- The top-level design maps to a defined set of FPGA pins. The I/O banking on Gowin devices requires careful attention to voltage levels and timing constraints.
- Audio path: route the digital waveform to a suitable DAC or PWM scheme. If you plan to use an external DAC, ensure the PWM or digital-to-analog path aligns with the chosen interface.
- Control path: input pins for trigger events, gate signals, or external control lines can be wired to the MA55-like control bus. Debounce logic may be included to ensure clean triggers.
- Clocking: a stable clock serves as the heart of the design. If your Tang Nano 9K variant uses a specific oscillator, the design should be able to pin down that clock source to reduce jitter.
- Debug: optional debug pins or a small JTAG interface can assist in diagnosing issues during development.

Gottlieb MA55 compatibility and System80 context
- This project aims to capture the spirit and behavior of the MA55 sound board within an FPGA framework. It is not a one-to-one replica but a faithful, programmable approximation that captures core timbral and envelope characteristics.
- Interfacing with System80-era systems benefits from careful timing alignment and robust I/O handshakes. The design provides hooks to integrate with a System80-like environment where a sound engine listens for events and responds with appropriate audio output.

Testing and validation approach
- Functional tests: check that notes trigger correctly, envelopes follow the expected ADSR behavior, and multi-voice scenarios blend without clipping.
- Timing tests: verify that clock rates and sample generation align with the intended audio sample rate. Adjust clock dividers or multipliers if needed.
- Noise and stability checks: ensure that noise-based modulation does not produce audible artifacts that skew the signal quality.
- Integration tests: connect the board to a simplified MA55 cabling setup to verify compatibility with common control schemes used in Gottlieb-era cabinets.
